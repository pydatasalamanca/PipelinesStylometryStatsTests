### Data Pipelines with Luigi

Obtain, process, train, validate, ... From small to big data related processes, all can be split into different steps dependent on each other, which add their own logic, and have domain specific requirements.

The talk will assess how the use of pipelines can increase modularity, ease the orchestration of tasks and help with scalability.
We will focus on Luigi: a Python package alternative built at Spotify used for building and managing data pipelines.

### Data Analysis with R – Filolab: stylometry applied to philology

Have you ever as a philologist dreamed of reconciling literature and statistics, or literary style with data science?
Not so used and known yet, R language for Statistical Computing can open a world of possibilities in the humanities field. And it is not even as hard as it looks!

For this reason we propose this worshop that would help you to use some univariate statistics test in Python.
